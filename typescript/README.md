# Typescript Examples for the Looker API

The examples in this folder are set up for `yarn`. If you don't have `yarn` installed already, you'll need to [install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) it.

## Using yarn

Use

```bash
yarn ts-node {filename} [other command-line options]
```

to run a Typescript SDK example file.

## Example list

Very brief descriptions of the examples and the link to the main example/project file are provided here. For more information on an example, look at the source file.

### User management

### Data downloads
