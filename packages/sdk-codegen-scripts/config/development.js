  Example configuration file showing how to override CodeGenerator settings.

  NOTE: This file does not actually override any typescript generator values. It shows how they CAN be overridden.

  See https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config for node config documentation

  TL;DR extracted from https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Configuration-Files
  - Set the `NODE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable to point to the folder containing your configuration file
  - Set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable if you want to use a configuration file with a base name other
    than `default` or `development`

  or, use NODE_CONFIG as described in https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Command-Line-Overrides

  Overrides must use the language name from `/packages/sdk-codegen/src/codeGenerators.ts` as the key

  Only top-level properties as implemented in the relevant code generator can be changed.
  See ICodegen for the standard list.

  See https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/blob/master/test/config/default.js for advanced config file syntax

  The `typescript` section declared below is an example that uses exactly the same values as the default typescript
  generator to demonstrate how generation attributes can be overridden after the generator is initialized.

  getGenerator() in `../src/languages.ts` processes these configuration values
