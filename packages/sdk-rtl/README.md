# Looker SDK Runtime Library

The Looker Typescript/Javascript SDK depends on the runtime code in this package.

The source code in this package is almost all completely generic REST request/response processing code.

The `@looker/sdk` package is updated with every Looker release. This package has a much longer update/release cycle.

**DISCLAIMER**: This is a _beta_ version of the Looker SDK runtime library. Implementations are still subject to change.
