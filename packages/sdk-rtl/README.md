# Looker SDK Runtime Library

The Looker TypeScript/JavaScript SDK depends on the runtime code in this package.

The source code in this package is almost all completely generic REST request/response processing code.

The `@looker/sdk` and `@looker/sdk-node` packages are updated with every Looker release. This package has a much longer update/release cycle.
