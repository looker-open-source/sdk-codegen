   * ### Present client credentials to obtain an authorization token
   *
   * Looker API implements the OAuth2 [Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/r/api/outh2_resource_owner_pc) pattern.
   * The client credentials required for this login must be obtained by creating an API key on a user account
   * in the Looker Admin console. The API key consists of a public `client_id` and a private `client_secret`.
   *
   * The access token returned by `login` must be used in the HTTP Authorization header of subsequent
   * API requests, like this:
   * ```
   * Authorization: token 4QDkCyCtZzYgj4C2p2cj3csJH7zqS5RzKs2kTnG4
   * ```
   * Replace "4QDkCy..." with the `access_token` value returned by `login`.
   * The word `token` is a string literal and must be included exactly as shown.
   *
   * This function can accept `client_id` and `client_secret` parameters as URL query params or as www-form-urlencoded params in the body of the HTTP request. Since there is a small risk that URL parameters may be visible to intermediate nodes on the network route (proxies, routers, etc), passing credentials in the body of the request is considered more secure than URL params.
   *
   * Example of passing credentials in the HTTP request body:
   * ````
   * POST HTTP /login
   * Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   *
   * client_id=CGc9B7v7J48dQSJvxxx&client_secret=nNVS9cSS3xNpSC9JdsBvvvvv
   * ````
   *
   * ### Best Practice:
   * Always pass credentials in body params. Pass credentials in URL query params **only** when you cannot pass body params due to application, tool, or other limitations.
   *
   * For more information and detailed examples of Looker API authorization, see [How to Authenticate to Looker API](https://github.com/looker/looker-sdk-ruby/blob/master/authentication.md).

  /**
   * ### Create an access token that runs as a given user.
   *
   * This can only be called by an authenticated admin user. It allows that admin to generate a new
   * authentication token for the user with the given user id. That token can then be used for subsequent
   * API calls - which are then performed *as* that target user.
   *
   * The target user does *not* need to have a pre-existing API client_id/client_secret pair. And, no such
   * credentials are created by this call.
   *
   * This allows for building systems where api user authentication for an arbitrary number of users is done
   * outside of Looker and funneled through a single 'service account' with admin permissions. Note that a
   * new access token is generated on each call. If target users are going to be making numerous API
   * calls in a short period then it is wise to cache this authentication token rather than call this before
   * each of those API calls.
   *
   * See 'login' for more detail on the access token and how to use it.

   * ### Create Signed Embed URL
   *
   * Creates a signed embed URL and cryptographically signs it with an embed secret.
   * This signed URL can then be used to instantiate a Looker embed session in a PBL web application.
   * Do not make any modifications to the returned URL - any change may invalidate the signature and
   * cause the URL to fail to load a Looker embed session.
   *
   * A signed embed URL can only be **used once**. After the URL has been used to request a page from the
   * Looker server, it is invalid. Future requests using the same URL will fail. This is to prevent
   * 'replay attacks'.
   *
   * The `target_url` property must be a complete URL of a Looker UI page - scheme, hostname, path and query params.
   * To load a dashboard with id 56 and with a filter of `Date=1 years`, the looker URL would look like `https:/myname.looker.com/dashboards/56?Date=1%20years`.
   * The best way to obtain this `target_url` is to navigate to the desired Looker page in your web browser and use the "Get embed URL" menu option
   * to copy it to your clipboard and paste it into the `target_url` property as a quoted string value in this API request.
   *
   * Permissions for the embed user are defined by the groups in which the embed user is a member (`group_ids` property)
   * and the lists of models and permissions assigned to the embed user.
   * At a minimum, you must provide values for either the `group_ids` property, or **both** the models and permissions properties.
   * These properties are additive; an embed user can be a member of certain groups AND be granted access to models and permissions.
   *
   * The embed user's access is the union of permissions granted by the `group_ids`, `models`, and `permissions` properties.
   *
   * This function does not strictly require all group_ids, user attribute names, or model names to exist at the moment the
   * embed url is created. Unknown group_id, user attribute names or model names will be passed through to the output URL.
   *
   * To diagnose potential problems with an SSO embed URL, you can copy the signed URL into the Embed URI Validator text box in `<your looker instance>/admin/embed`.
   *
   * The `secret_id` parameter is optional. If specified, its value must be the id of an active secret defined in the Looker instance.
   * if not specified, the URL will be signed using the most recent active signing secret. If there is no active secret for signing embed urls,
   * a default secret will be created. This default secret is encrypted using HMAC/SHA-256.
   *
   * The `embed_domain` parameter is optional. If specified and valid, the domain will be added to the embed domain allowlist if it is missing.
   *
   * #### Security Note
   * Protect this signed URL as you would an access token or password credentials - do not write
   * it to disk, do not pass it to a third party, and only pass it through a secure HTTPS
   * encrypted transport.
   *
   *
   * Calls to this endpoint require [Embedding](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/r/looker-core-feature-embed) to be enabled

  /**
   * ### Run an URL encoded query.
   *
   * This requires the caller to encode the specifiers for the query into the URL query part using
   * Looker-specific syntax as explained below.
   *
   * Generally, you would want to use one of the methods that takes the parameters as json in the POST body
   * for creating and/or running queries. This method exists for cases where one really needs to encode the
   * parameters into the URL of a single 'GET' request. This matches the way that the Looker UI formats
   * 'explore' URLs etc.
   *
   * The parameters here are very similar to the json body formatting except that the filter syntax is
   * tricky. Unfortunately, this format makes this method not currently callable via the 'Try it out!' button
   * in this documentation page. But, this is callable when creating URLs manually or when using the Looker SDK.
   *
   * Here is an example inline query URL:
   *
   * ```
   * https://looker.mycompany.com:19999/api/3.0/queries/models/thelook/views/inventory_items/run/json?fields=category.name,inventory_items.days_in_inventory_tier,products.count&f[category.name]=socks&sorts=products.count+desc+0&limit=500&query_timezone=America/Los_Angeles
   * ```
   *
   * When invoking this endpoint with the Ruby SDK, pass the query parameter parts as a hash. The hash to match the above would look like:
   *
   * ```ruby
   * query_params =
   * {
   *   fields: "category.name,inventory_items.days_in_inventory_tier,products.count",
   *   :"f[category.name]" => "socks",
   *   sorts: "products.count desc 0",
   *   limit: "500",
   *   query_timezone: "America/Los_Angeles"
   * }
   * response = ruby_sdk.run_url_encoded_query('thelook','inventory_items','json', query_params)
   *
   * ```
   *
   * Again, it is generally easier to use the variant of this method that passes the full query in the POST body.
   * This method is available for cases where other alternatives won't fit the need.

   * This can be useful for testing modifications to an existing scheduled plan before committing to a production schedule.
   *
   * This function internally performs the following operations:
   *
   * 1. Copies the properties of the existing scheduled plan into a new scheduled plan
   * 2. Copies any properties passed in the JSON body of this request into the new scheduled plan (replacing the original values)
   * 3. Creates the new scheduled plan
   * 4. Runs the new scheduled plan
   *
   * The original scheduled plan is not modified by this operation.
   * Admins can create, modify, and run scheduled plans on behalf of other users by specifying a user id.
   * Non-admins can only create, modify, and run their own scheduled plans.

   *
   * | format | Description
   * | :-----------: | :--- |
   * | json | A JSON object containing a `data` property which contains an array of JSON objects, one per row. No metadata.
   * | json_detail | Row data plus metadata describing the fields, pivots, table calcs, and other aspects of the query
   * | inline_json | Same as the JSON format, except that the `data` property is a string containing JSON-escaped row data. Additional properties describe the data operation. This format is primarily used to send data to web hooks so that the web hook doesn't have to re-encode the JSON row data in order to pass it on to its ultimate destination.
   * | csv | Comma separated values with a header
   * | txt | Tab separated values with a header
   * | html | Simple html
   * | xlsx | MS Excel spreadsheet
   * | wysiwyg_pdf | Dashboard rendered in a tiled layout to produce a PDF document
   * | assembled_pdf | Dashboard rendered in a single column layout to produce a PDF document
   * | wysiwyg_png | Dashboard rendered in a tiled layout to produce a PNG image
   * ||
   *
   * Valid formats vary by destination type and source object. `wysiwyg_pdf` is only valid for dashboards, for example.
   *

   *
   * The value of a user attribute for a given user is determined by searching the following locations, in this order:
   *
   * 1. the user's account settings
   * 2. the groups that the user is a member of
   * 3. the default value of the user attribute, if any

   * ### Get A Workspace

   *
   * A workspace defines which versions of project files will be used to evaluate expressions
   * and operations that use model definitions - operations such as running queries or rendering dashboards.
   * Each project has its own git repository, and each project in a workspace may be configured to reference
   * particular branch or revision within their respective repositories.
   *
   * There are two predefined workspaces available: "production" and "dev".
   *
   * The production workspace is shared across all Looker users. Models in the production workspace are read-only.
   * Changing files in production is accomplished by modifying files in a git branch and using Pull Requests
   * to merge the changes from the dev branch into the production branch, and then telling
   * Looker to sync with production.
   *
   * The dev workspace is local to each Looker user. Changes made to project/model files in the dev workspace only affect
   * that user, and only when the dev workspace is selected as the active workspace for the API session.
   * (See set_session_workspace()).
   *
   * The dev workspace is NOT unique to an API session. Two applications accessing the Looker API using
   * the same user account will see the same files in the dev workspace. To avoid collisions between
   * API clients it's best to have each client login with API credentials for a different user account.
   *
   * Changes made to files in a dev workspace are persistent across API sessions. It's a good
   * idea to commit any changes you've made to the git repository, but not strictly required. Your modified files
   * reside in a special user-specific directory on the Looker server and will still be there when you login in again
   * later and use update_session(workspace_id: "dev") to select the dev workspace for the new API session.
