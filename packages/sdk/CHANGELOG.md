# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Current]

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The internally constructed `stream` property of the SDK object has been removed. Instead, use:

```ts
import { Looker40SDKStream } from '@looker/sdk'

const sdkStream = new Looker40SDKStream(sdk.authSession)
```

See the [README](README.md#streaming-api-responses) for more information.

- ApiMethods no longer has apiVersion as a constructor parameter to clean up use in other factories such as the Extension SDK.
  This shouldn't affect consumers of the SDK-level declarations.
- SDK objects now have a static `ApiVersion` that reports the version of the API being used by that sdk
- Modified the packaging method of the TS SDKs to support better tree-shaking
