# Looker SDK code generator utility files

This package contains utility routines for the SDK code generator projects

The code in this package is really trivial and should not be used directly in your own projects.


**DEPRECATED AND NOT SUPPORTED**: Looker does not support direct use of this package, other than via indirect use in the
[SDK Codegen project](https://github.com/looker-open-source/sdk-codegen) repository.

See the [SDK Codegen project](https://github.com/looker-open-source/sdk-codegen) repository for more information.
