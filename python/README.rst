Looker SDK
===========

The Looker SDK for Python provides a convenient way to communicate with the
Looker API available on your Looker server. The library requires python3.7+
and is annotated using the typing module.

**DISCLAIMER**: This is an experimental version of the Looker SDK, using
a new code generator developed by Looker. You should expect some things to
just not work, and foresee drastic changes to the SDK source code until an
official beta begins.


Introduction in code
--------------------

::

    from looker_sdk import client, models, error

    # client calls will now automatically authenticate using the
    # api3credentials specified in 'Looker.ini'
    looker_client = client.setup('Looker.ini')
    looker_ini_user = looker_client.me()

    # models can be passed named parameters to the constructor
    new_user = models.WriteUser(first_name="John", last_name="Doe")

    # as well as have fields set on the instance
    new_user.is_disabled = True
    new_user.locale = "fr"

    # create the user with the client
    created_user = looker_client.create_user(new_user)

    # see typing explanation below for why this line is helpfull
    assert isinstance(created_user.id, int)
    user_id = created_user.id

    # Updating the user: change locale and explicitly nullify
    # first_name via the constructor
    update_user = models.WriteUser(
        locale="uk", first_name=models.EXPLICIT_NULL  # do not use None
    )

    # we can also nullify last_name on the instance
    update_user.last_name = models.EXPLICIT_NULL

    # update the user with the client
    updated_user = looker_client.update_user(
        user_id=created_user.id, body=update_user
    )

    # perform API calls on behalf of the user: "sudo"
    try:
        looker_client.login_user(user_id)
    except error.SDKError:
        # oops, we need to set the user as enabled first
        pass

    looker_client.update_user(
        user_id=user_id, body=models.WriteUser(is_disabled=False)
    )
    looker_client.login_user(user_id)
    sudo_user = looker_client.me()
    assert sudo_user.id == user_id
    assert sudo_user.id != looker_ini_user.id

    # logout to switch back to authenticating per 'Looker.ini'
    looker_client.logout()
    assert looker_client.me().id == looker_ini_user.id

    # "sudo" using a context manager
    with looker_client.login_user(user_id):
        assert looker_client.me().id == sudo_user.id

    # exiting context manager is the same as
    # calling looker_client.logout()
    assert looker_client.me() == looker_ini_user.id

    # cleanup
    looker_client.delete_user(user_id)


Sample project setup
--------------------

We'll use `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation>`_ to install
python3.7 and `pipenv <https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today>`_
to manage project dependencies. Once you have them installed follow these steps

Create a project directory (consider
`cookiecutter <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage#quickstart>`_
as an alternative)::

    $ mkdir looker-sdk-example

Install python3.7 and use it for this directory::

    $ cd looker-sdk-example/
    $ pyenv install 3.7.4  # pyenv install --list to see latest 3.7
    $ pyenv local 3.7.4


Install looker_sdk using pipenv::

    $ pipenv install --pre looker_sdk

Now you should be able to copy the example code above into a `example.py` file
and execute it. Caution the example code will actually create and delete
a user in your looker instance::

    $ python example.py


Configuring the SDK
-------------------

In order to configure the SDK client, create a "Looker.ini" file to reference
during `client.setup()`

example file:

::

    [Looker]
    # API version is required
    api_version=3.1
    # Base URL for API. Do not include /api/* in the url
    base_url=https://self-signed.looker.com:19999
    # API 3 client id
    client_id=YourClientID
    # API 3 client secret
    client_secret=YourClientSecret
    # Set to false if testing locally against self-signed certs. Otherwise leave True
    verify_ssl=True

Typing
------

All client calls are annotated with with basic types as well as model types.
Many client calls accept a `fields` argument which limits the JSON response
from the API to the specified fields. For this reason, the fields on the
model are all typed as `Optional[]`. The effect is that static code analysis
(`mypy <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for example) will complain
if you try to use a field from a model instance in a place that
requires the value not be `Optional`. From the example above::

    created_user = looker_client.create_user(new_user)

Here, `created_user.id` has type `Optional[int]`. We want to use that value
in the `update_user()` call but we see this mypy error::

    user_id = created_user.id
    # Argument "user_id" to "update_user" of "LookerSDK"
    # has incompatible type "Optional[int]"; expected "int"
    looker_client.update_user(user_id, ...)

This is because `update_user` is annotated like this::

    def update_user(
        self,
        user_id: int,  # note: not Optional[int]
        body: models.WriteUser,
        fields: Optional[str] = None,
    ) -> models.User:

*We* know we didn't exclude `id` from the response by passing in something like
`fields='first_name,last_name'`. We *know* that `created_user.id` will be
populated with an `int`. However, mypy does not so we must guide it in one
of the following ways::

    # assert about the type
    assert isinstance(user_id, int)

    # or cast
    from typing import cast
    user_id = cast(created_user.id, int)

Now mypy is happy with `update_user(user_id, ...)`
