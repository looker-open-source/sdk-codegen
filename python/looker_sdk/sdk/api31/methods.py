    # region ApiAuth: API Authentication

    # ### Present client credentials to obtain an authorization token
    #
    # Looker API implements the OAuth2 [Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/r/api/outh2_resource_owner_pc) pattern.
    # The client credentials required for this login must be obtained by creating an API3 key on a user account
    # in the Looker Admin console. The API3 key consists of a public `client_id` and a private `client_secret`.
    #
    # The access token returned by `login` must be used in the HTTP Authorization header of subsequent
    # API requests, like this:
    # ```
    # Authorization: token 4QDkCyCtZzYgj4C2p2cj3csJH7zqS5RzKs2kTnG4
    # ```
    # Replace "4QDkCy..." with the `access_token` value returned by `login`.
    # The word `token` is a string literal and must be included exactly as shown.
    #
    # This function can accept `client_id` and `client_secret` parameters as URL query params or as www-form-urlencoded params in the body of the HTTP request. Since there is a small risk that URL parameters may be visible to intermediate nodes on the network route (proxies, routers, etc), passing credentials in the body of the request is considered more secure than URL params.
    #
    # Example of passing credentials in the HTTP request body:
    # ````
    # POST HTTP /login
    # Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    #
    # client_id=CGc9B7v7J48dQSJvxxx&client_secret=nNVS9cSS3xNpSC9JdsBvvvvv
    # ````
    #
    # ### Best Practice:
    # Always pass credentials in body params. Pass credentials in URL query params **only** when you cannot pass body params due to application, tool, or other limitations.
    #
    # For more information and detailed examples of Looker API authorization, see [How to Authenticate to Looker API3](https://github.com/looker/looker-sdk-ruby/blob/master/authentication.md).

    # ### Create an access token that runs as a given user.
    #
    # This can only be called by an authenticated admin user. It allows that admin to generate a new
    # authentication token for the user with the given user id. That token can then be used for subsequent
    # API calls - which are then performed *as* that target user.
    #
    # The target user does *not* need to have a pre-existing API client_id/client_secret pair. And, no such
    # credentials are created by this call.

    # outside of Looker and funneled through a single 'service account' with admin permissions. Note that a
    # new access token is generated on each call. If target users are going to be making numerous API
    # calls in a short period then it is wise to cache this authentication token rather than call this before
    # each of those API calls.

    # ### Create SSO Embed URL
    #
    # Creates an SSO embed URL and cryptographically signs it with an embed secret.
    # This signed URL can then be used to instantiate a Looker embed session in a PBL web application.
    # Do not make any modifications to this URL - any change may invalidate the signature and
    # cause the URL to fail to load a Looker embed session.
    #
    # A signed SSO embed URL can only be used once. After it has been used to request a page from the
    # Looker server, the URL is invalid. Future requests using the same URL will fail. This is to prevent
    # 'replay attacks'.
    #
    # The `target_url` property must be a complete URL of a Looker UI page - scheme, hostname, path and query params.
    # To load a dashboard with id 56 and with a filter of `Date=1 years`, the looker URL would look like `https:/myname.looker.com/dashboards/56?Date=1%20years`.
    # The best way to obtain this target_url is to navigate to the desired Looker page in your web browser,
    # copy the URL shown in the browser address bar and paste it into the `target_url` property as a quoted string value in this API request.
    #
    # Permissions for the embed user are defined by the groups in which the embed user is a member (group_ids property)
    # and the lists of models and permissions assigned to the embed user.
    # At a minimum, you must provide values for either the group_ids property, or both the models and permissions properties.
    # These properties are additive; an embed user can be a member of certain groups AND be granted access to models and permissions.
    #
    # The embed user's access is the union of permissions granted by the group_ids, models, and permissions properties.
    #
    # This function does not strictly require all group_ids, user attribute names, or model names to exist at the moment the
    # SSO embed url is created. Unknown group_id, user attribute names or model names will be passed through to the output URL.
    # To diagnose potential problems with an SSO embed URL, you can copy the signed URL into the Embed URI Validator text box in `<your looker instance>/admin/embed`.
    #
    # The `secret_id` parameter is optional. If specified, its value must be the id of an active secret defined in the Looker instance.
    # if not specified, the URL will be signed using the newest active secret defined in the Looker instance.
    #
    # #### Security Note
    # Protect this signed URL as you would an access token or password credentials - do not write
    # it to disk, do not pass it to a third party, and only pass it through a secure HTTPS
    # encrypted transport.

    # ### Modify a Look
    #
    # Use this function to modify parts of a look. Property values given in a call to `update_look` are
    # applied to the existing look, so there's no need to include properties whose values are not changing.
    # It's best to specify only the properties you want to change and leave everything else out
    # of your `update_look` call. **Look properties marked 'read-only' will be ignored.**
    #
    # When a user deletes a look in the Looker UI, the look data remains in the database but is
    # marked with a deleted flag ("soft-deleted"). Soft-deleted looks can be undeleted (by an admin)
    # if the delete was in error.
    #
    # To soft-delete a look via the API, use [update_look()](#!/Look/update_look) to change the look's `deleted` property to `true`.
    # You can undelete a look by calling `update_look` to change the look's `deleted` property to `false`.
    #
    # Soft-deleted looks are excluded from the results of [all_looks()](#!/Look/all_looks) and [search_looks()](#!/Look/search_looks), so they
    # essentially disappear from view even though they still reside in the db.
    # In API 3.1 and later, you can pass `deleted: true` as a parameter to [search_looks()](#!/3.1/Look/search_looks) to list soft-deleted looks.
    #
    # NOTE: [delete_look()](#!/Look/delete_look) performs a "hard delete" - the look data is removed from the Looker
    # database and destroyed. There is no "undo" for `delete_look()`.

    # #### Configuring Git for a Project
    #
    # To set up a Looker project with a remote git repository, follow these steps:
    #
    # 1. Call `update_session` to select the 'dev' workspace.
    # 1. Call `create_git_deploy_key` to create a new deploy key for the project
    # 1. Copy the deploy key text into the remote git repository's ssh key configuration
    # 1. Call `update_project` to set project's `git_remote_url` ()and `git_service_name`, if necessary).
    #
    # When you modify a project's `git_remote_url`, Looker connects to the remote repository to fetch
    # metadata. The remote git repository MUST be configured with the Looker-generated deploy
    # key for this project prior to setting the project's `git_remote_url`.
    #
    # To set up a Looker project with a git repository residing on the Looker server (a 'bare' git repo):
    #
    # 1. Call `update_session` to select the 'dev' workspace.
    # 1. Call `update_project` setting `git_remote_url` to null and `git_service_name` to "bare".

    # You can use the Looker explore page to build a query and then choose the 'Share' option to
    # show the share url for the query. Share urls generally look something like 'https://looker.yourcompany/x/vwGSbfc'.
    # The trailing 'vwGSbfc' is the share slug. You can pass that string to this api method to get details about the query.
    # Those details include the 'id' that you can use to run the query. Or, you can copy the query body
    # (perhaps with your own modification) and use that as the basis to make/run new queries.

    # ### Run an URL encoded query.
    #
    # This requires the caller to encode the specifiers for the query into the URL query part using
    # Looker-specific syntax as explained below.
    #
    # Generally, you would want to use one of the methods that takes the parameters as json in the POST body
    # for creating and/or running queries. This method exists for cases where one really needs to encode the
    # parameters into the URL of a single 'GET' request. This matches the way that the Looker UI formats
    # 'explore' URLs etc.
    #
    # The parameters here are very similar to the json body formatting except that the filter syntax is
    # tricky. Unfortunately, this format makes this method not currently callable via the 'Try it out!' button
    # in this documentation page. But, this is callable when creating URLs manually or when using the Looker SDK.
    #
    # Here is an example inline query URL:
    #
    # ```
    # https://looker.mycompany.com:19999/api/3.0/queries/models/thelook/views/inventory_items/run/json?fields=category.name,inventory_items.days_in_inventory_tier,products.count&f[category.name]=socks&sorts=products.count+desc+0&limit=500&query_timezone=America/Los_Angeles
    # ```
    #
    # When invoking this endpoint with the Ruby SDK, pass the query parameter parts as a hash. The hash to match the above would look like:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # query_params =
    # {
    #   fields: "category.name,inventory_items.days_in_inventory_tier,products.count",
    #   :"f[category.name]" => "socks",
    #   sorts: "products.count desc 0",
    #   limit: "500",
    #   query_timezone: "America/Los_Angeles"
    # }
    # response = ruby_sdk.run_url_encoded_query('thelook','inventory_items','json', query_params)
    #
    # ```
    #
    # Again, it is generally easier to use the variant of this method that passes the full query in the POST body.
    # This method is available for cases where other alternatives won't fit the need.
    #
    # Supported formats:

    # ### Create Merge Query
    #
    # Creates a new merge query object.
    #
    # A merge query takes the results of one or more queries and combines (merges) the results
    # according to field mapping definitions. The result is similar to a SQL left outer join.
    #
    # A merge query can merge results of queries from different SQL databases.
    #
    # The order that queries are defined in the source_queries array property is significant. The
    # first query in the array defines the primary key into which the results of subsequent
    # queries will be merged.
    #
    # Like model/view query objects, merge queries are immutable and have structural identity - if
    # you make a request to create a new merge query that is identical to an existing merge query,
    # the existing merge query will be returned instead of creating a duplicate. Conversely, any
    # change to the contents of a merge query will produce a new object with a new id.

    # #### Scheduled Plan Destination Formats
    #
    # Scheduled plan destinations must specify the data format to produce and send to the destination.
    #
    # Formats:
    #
    # | format | Description
    # | :-----------: | :--- |
    # | json | A JSON object containing a `data` property which contains an array of JSON objects, one per row. No metadata.
    # | json_detail | Row data plus metadata describing the fields, pivots, table calcs, and other aspects of the query
    # | inline_json | Same as the JSON format, except that the `data` property is a string containing JSON-escaped row data. Additional properties describe the data operation. This format is primarily used to send data to web hooks so that the web hook doesn't have to re-encode the JSON row data in order to pass it on to its ultimate destination.

    # ### Create a Scheduled Plan
    #
    # Create a scheduled plan to render a Look or Dashboard on a recurring schedule.
    #
    # To create a scheduled plan, you MUST provide values for the following fields:
    # `name`
    # and
    # `look_id`, `dashboard_id`, `lookml_dashboard_id`, or `query_id`
    # and
    # `cron_tab` or `datagroup`
    # and
    # at least one scheduled_plan_destination
    #
    # A scheduled plan MUST have at least one scheduled_plan_destination defined.
    #
    # When `look_id` is set, `require_no_results`, `require_results`, and `require_change` are all required.
    #
    # If `create_scheduled_plan` fails with a 422 error, be sure to look at the error messages in the response which will explain exactly what fields are missing or values that are incompatible.
    #
    # The queries that provide the data for the look or dashboard are run in the context of user account that owns the scheduled plan.
    #
    # When `run_as_recipient` is `false` or not specified, the queries that provide the data for the
    # look or dashboard are run in the context of user account that owns the scheduled plan.
    #
    # When `run_as_recipient` is `true` and all the email recipients are Looker user accounts, the
    # queries are run in the context of each recipient, so different recipients may see different
    # data from the same scheduled render of a look or dashboard. For more details, see [Run As Recipient](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/r/admin/run-as-recipient).
    #
    # Admins can create and modify scheduled plans on behalf of other users by specifying a user id.
    # Non-admin users may not create or modify scheduled plans by or for other users.

    # ### Search Spaces
    #
    #   Returns an **array of space objects** that match the given search criteria.
    #
    #   If multiple search params are given and `filter_or` is FALSE or not specified,
    # search params are combined in a logical AND operation.
    # Only rows that match *all* search param criteria will be returned.
    #
    # If `filter_or` is TRUE, multiple search params are combined in a logical OR operation.
    # Results will include rows that match **any** of the search criteria.
    #
    # String search params use case-insensitive matching.
    # String search params can contain `%` and '_' as SQL LIKE pattern match wildcard expressions.
    # example="dan%" will match "danger" and "Danzig" but not "David"
    # example="D_m%" will match "Damage" and "dump"
    #
    # Integer search params can accept a single value or a comma separated list of values. The multiple
    # values will be combined under a logical OR operation - results will match at least one of
    # the given values.
    #
    # Most search params can accept "IS NULL" and "NOT NULL" as special expressions to match
    # or exclude (respectively) rows where the column is null.
    #
    # Boolean search params accept only "true" and "false" as values.
    #
    #
    #   The parameters `limit`, and `offset` are recommended for fetching results in page-size chunks.

    # This is used to do things like find users by their embed external_user_id. Or, find the user with
    # a given api3 client_id, etc. The 'credential_type' matches the 'type' name of the various credential
    # types. It must be one of the values listed in the table below. The 'credential_id' is your unique Id
    # for the user and is specific to each type of credential.
    #
    # An example using the Ruby sdk might look like:
    #
    # `sdk.user_for_credential('embed', 'customer-4959425')`
    #
    # This table shows the supported 'Credential Type' strings. The right column is for reference; it shows
    # which field in the given credential type is actually searched when finding a user with the supplied
    # 'credential_id'.
    #
    # | Credential Types | Id Field Matched |
    # | ---------------- | ---------------- |
    # | email            | email            |

    #
    # This function defines all values for a user attribute defined by user groups. This is a global setting, potentially affecting
    # all users in the system. This function replaces any existing group value definitions for the indicated user attribute.
    #
    # The value of a user attribute for a given user is determined by searching the following locations, in this order:
    #
    # 1. the user's account settings
    # 2. the groups that the user is a member of
    # 3. the default value of the user attribute, if any
    #
    # The user may be a member of multiple groups which define different values for that user attribute. The order of items in the group_values parameter
    # determines which group takes priority for that user. Lowest array index wins.
    #
    # An alternate method to indicate the selection precedence of group-values is to assign numbers to the 'rank' property of each
    # group-value object in the array. Lowest 'rank' value wins. If you use this technique, you must assign a
    # rank value to every group-value object in the array.
    #
    #   To set a user attribute value for a single user, see [Set User Attribute User Value](#!/User/set_user_attribute_user_value).

    # ### Get A Workspace
    #
    # Returns information about a workspace such as the git status and selected branches
    # of all projects available to the caller's user account.
    #
    # A workspace defines which versions of project files will be used to evaluate expressions
    # and operations that use model definitions - operations such as running queries or rendering dashboards.
    # Each project has its own git repository, and each project in a workspace may be configured to reference
    # particular branch or revision within their respective repositories.
    #
    # There are two predefined workspaces available: "production" and "dev".
    #
    # The production workspace is shared across all Looker users. Models in the production workspace are read-only.
    # Changing files in production is accomplished by modifying files in a git branch and using Pull Requests
    # to merge the changes from the dev branch into the production branch, and then telling
    # Looker to sync with production.
    #
    # The dev workspace is local to each Looker user. Changes made to project/model files in the dev workspace only affect
    # that user, and only when the dev workspace is selected as the active workspace for the API session.
    # (See set_session_workspace()).
    #
    # The dev workspace is NOT unique to an API session. Two applications accessing the Looker API using
    # the same user account will see the same files in the dev workspace. To avoid collisions between
    # API clients it's best to have each client login with API3 credentials for a different user account.
    #
    # Changes made to files in a dev workspace are persistent across API sessions. It's a good
    # idea to commit any changes you've made to the git repository, but not strictly required. Your modified files
    # reside in a special user-specific directory on the Looker server and will still be there when you login in again
    # later and use update_session(workspace_id: "dev") to select the dev workspace for the new API session.
