## Sample iOS Swift SDK Example

### Setting the Looker SDK configuration

There are a couple different ways to configure the SDK for a Looker server. 
This example sets them as environment variables. 
To set the environment vars go to `Product`>`Scheme`>`Edit Scheme...` 
and add

- `LOOKERSDK_BASE_URL` for the Looker API server URL, like `https://foo.looker.com:19999`
- `LOOKER_API_VERSION` as `3.1`
- `LOOKERSDK_CLIENT_ID` for the API 3 Client ID 
- `LOOKERSDK_CLIENT_SECRET` for the API 3 Client Secret
