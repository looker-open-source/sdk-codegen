# Examples for the Looker SDKs

This repository contains source code examples and projects that use SDKs to communicate with the Looker API. Examples are organized by folder names that correspond to the name of the programming language used.

This is a constantly-evolving repository, where examples could change, appear, and disappear at any time.

## Configuration

To simplify configuring API credential information for the examples, most of the examples use a `looker.ini` file in the root directory of this repository. It can be exactly the same as the configuration file used for the SDK code generator.

See [Configuring `looker.ini`](../../README.md#configuring-lookerini) for help with configuring your Looker server and API credentials.

## Please contribute

All are welcome to submit examples. Please feel free to submit a PR for any examples you want to share. Thank you!
