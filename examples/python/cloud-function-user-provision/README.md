# Cloud Function Example: User Provisioner

This repository contains a [Google Cloud Function](https://cloud.google.com/functions) that leverages Looker Python SDK. The repository can be used as a starter template to build serverless microservices that interact with Looker through the following workflow:

1. Send a POST request to trigger an HTTP-based Cloud Function
2. Initialize the Looker Python SDK
3. Call Looker SDK methods and build custom logic to manage users, content, queries, etc.

In this repository, the `main.py` file takes an email address as an input and checks if this email has been registered with an existing Looker user. If an exisiting user is found, an email to reset the password will be sent to the user. Otherwise, a new user will be created, and a setup email will be sent.

For more use cases and Python examples, check out [Looker's Python SDK examples](https://github.com/looker-open-source/sdk-codegen/tree/main/examples/python).

## Setup

The following steps assume deployment using Google Cloud UI Console. Check out ["Your First Function: Python"](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/first-python) for steps to deploy using the `gcloud` command line tool

1. Obtain a [Looker API3 Key](https://docs.looker.com/admin-options/settings/users#api3_keys)

2. Follow the steps [provided here](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstart-python) to create a new Google Cloud Function

3. Configure runtime environment variables using the Cloud Function UI: Edit > Configuration > Runtime, build, connections and security settings > Runtime environment variables. Alternatively, environtment variables can be configured through the `os` module or a `.ini`. Check out [Configuring Looker Python SDK](https://github.com/looker-open-source/sdk-codegen/tree/main/python#configuring-the-sdk) to learn more

4. Copy and paste the contents of `main.py` in this repository into `main.py` file once inside Cloud Function's inline editor. Change the "Entry point" in the top right to `main`. `main.py` is executed once the function is triggered

5. Copy and paste the contents of `requirements.txt` in this repository to the `requirements.txt` file once inside Cloud Function's inline editor. This file is used to install neccessary libraries to execute the function

6. Deploy and test the function. Check out [this article](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstart-python#test_the_function) for instruction
