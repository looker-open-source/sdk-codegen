"""This Cloud Function leverages Looker Python SDK to manage user provision. The 
`main` function is used as the entry point to the code. It takes an email address 
as an input through a POST request, then checks if this email has been associated
with an existing Looker user. If an exisiting user is found, then an email to 
reset password will be sent. Otherwise, a new user will be created, and a setup email
will be sent.
