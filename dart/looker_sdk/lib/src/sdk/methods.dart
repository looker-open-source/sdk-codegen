  /// ### Present client credentials to obtain an authorization token
  ///
  /// Looker API implements the OAuth2 [Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant](https://looker.com/docs/r/api/outh2_resource_owner_pc) pattern.
  /// The client credentials required for this login must be obtained by creating an API3 key on a user account
  /// in the Looker Admin console. The API3 key consists of a public `client_id` and a private `client_secret`.
  ///
  /// The access token returned by `login` must be used in the HTTP Authorization header of subsequent
  /// API requests, like this:
  /// ```
  /// Authorization: token 4QDkCyCtZzYgj4C2p2cj3csJH7zqS5RzKs2kTnG4
  /// ```
  /// Replace "4QDkCy..." with the `access_token` value returned by `login`.
  /// The word `token` is a string literal and must be included exactly as shown.
  ///
  /// This function can accept `client_id` and `client_secret` parameters as URL query params or as www-form-urlencoded params in the body of the HTTP request. Since there is a small risk that URL parameters may be visible to intermediate nodes on the network route (proxies, routers, etc), passing credentials in the body of the request is considered more secure than URL params.
  ///
  /// Example of passing credentials in the HTTP request body:
  /// ````
  /// POST HTTP /login
  /// Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ///
  /// client_id=CGc9B7v7J48dQSJvxxx&client_secret=nNVS9cSS3xNpSC9JdsBvvvvv
  /// ````
  ///
  /// ### Best Practice:
  /// Always pass credentials in body params. Pass credentials in URL query params **only** when you cannot pass body params due to application, tool, or other limitations.

  /// tricky. Unfortunately, this format makes this method not currently callable via the 'Try it out!' button
  /// in this documentation page. But, this is callable when creating URLs manually or when using the Looker SDK.

  /// Here is an example inline query URL:
  ///
  /// ```

  /// ```
  ///
  /// When invoking this endpoint with the Ruby SDK, pass the query parameter parts as a hash. The hash to match the above would look like:

  /// ```ruby
  /// query_params =
  /// {
  ///   :fields => "category.name,inventory_items.days_in_inventory_tier,products.count",
  ///   :"f[category.name]" => "socks",
  ///   :sorts => "products.count desc 0",
